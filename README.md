# Portfolio_Project_Mars_Weather_Data
This project dynamically generates html by accessing data from a NASA api
that collects data from the Insight lander on Mars. Data will be pulled
from the api and displayed on the webbage upon users request. If data is 
not available then the user will also be notified.

Bootstrap is used to for responsive web design and styling. Jquery and ajax 
is used to manipulate the DOM and access the remote API.
